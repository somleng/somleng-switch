Somleng-Adhearsion is an Adhearsion application compatible with [Twilreapi](https://github.com/somleng/twilreapi) and [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml). It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Twilio routing calls through local operator, SIP trunk or PBX.

## Compatibilty

Currently Somleng-Adhearsion only supports [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/). Theoretically [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) should also work but it has not been tested.
