<!--
  ext-sip-ip is set to the public IP address of the NAT instance because this profile
  operates as a UAC (User Agent Client) behind a 1:1 NAT. The Contact header must contain
  an address that the UAS can reach through the NAT instance. By setting ext-sip-ip
  to the NAT instance's external IP, in-dialog SIP requests (ACK, BYE, etc.) sent
  from the UAS will correctly traverse the NAT and reach this FreeSWITCH instance.
