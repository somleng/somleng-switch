<!--
  ext-sip-ip is set to local_ip_v4 because when this profile is used FreeSWITCH is acting as a UAS
  behind a SIP Proxy. SIP subsequent requests (ACK, BYE, etc.) are routed through the proxy, which
  include Route headers. These requests are first sent to the proxy and then forwarded
  to the Contact header provided by FreeSWITCH. Since the Contact header must contain
  the reachable address within the local network (the private IP), we set ext-sip-ip
  to local_ip_v4 to ensure correct routing of in-dialog requests through the SIP Proxy.
